## 📌 Project Overview

The **Sunbeam Chatbot** is an **AI-powered, Agentic RAG-based chatbot** designed to provide **accurate, up-to-date, and contextual information** from the Sunbeam website.

Instead of relying on static data, the chatbot dynamically **scrapes live website content**, organizes it using **tools**, and answers user queries using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

The project follows **industry-grade AI architecture**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, and uses **Streamlit** for an interactive frontend.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Users visiting the Sunbeam website often face:
- Difficulty finding updated course & internship details
- Time-consuming navigation across multiple pages
- Lack of instant answers or document downloads

---

## 💡 Solution

The Sunbeam Chatbot solves this by:
- Scraping live website data
- Using **Agentic RAG** to ground responses in real data
- Selecting the correct **tool automatically**
- Returning text answers or **PDF documents**
- Providing a clean **Streamlit-based UI**

---

## 🧠 What is Agentic RAG?

**Agentic RAG** combines:
- Intelligent **Agents**
- Task-specific **Tools**
- Vector-based **Retrieval**
- LLM reasoning

The agent:
1. Understands the user query  
2. Chooses the correct tool  
3. Retrieves relevant data  
4. Generates a grounded response
